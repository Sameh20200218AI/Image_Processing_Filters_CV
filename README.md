# Image Processing Filters Project üé®üñºÔ∏è

## Description
I am excited to share my **Image Processing Filters Project**, where I applied various image processing techniques using popular libraries like **OpenCV**, **NumPy**, **Requests**, **PIL**, **IO**, and **Matplotlib**. This project demonstrates different filters and transformations applied to an image fetched directly from Wikipedia.

## Project Overview
This project covers a wide range of image processing techniques categorized into several sections:

### 1. Basic Filters
- Gaussian Blur (with different kernel sizes)
- Median Blur (with different kernel sizes)
- Bilateral Filter

### 2. Edge Detection Filters
- Canny Filter (with different thresholds)
- Laplacian Filter
- Sobel Filters (Sobel X & Sobel Y)

### 3. Morphological Operations
- Dilation
- Erosion
- Opening
- Closing
- Gradient
- Top Hat
- Black Hat

### 4. Color Manipulation
- Color Spaces (40, 44, 82)
- Channel Splitting (Blue, Green, Red)
- Brightness Adjustment
- Contrast Adjustment
- Sepia Filter

### 5. Thresholding Techniques
- Binary
- Binary Inverse
- Trunc
- To Zero
- Adaptive Thresholds (Adaptive 0 & Adaptive 1)

### 6. Artistic Effects
- Cartoon Effect
- Watercolor Effect

### 7. Geometric Transformations
- Flip Vertical
- Flip Horizontal
- Rotated 45¬∞

### 8. Advanced Filters
- Histogram Equalization
- CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)

### 9. Feature Detection
- Harris Corners
- ORB Features

### 10. PIL Filters
- Contour
- Emboss
- Edge Enhance
- Find Edges
- Sharpen
- Smooth
- Detail

### 11. Additional Stylization Filters
- Water Effect
- Waterfall Effect
- Glass Effect
- Oil Painting Effect
- Cartoon Effect
- Sketch Effect
- Charcoal Effect
- Mosaic Effect
- Heatmap Effect
- Neon Glow Effect
- Emboss Effect
- Pencil Sketch Effect
- Warp Effect
- Realistic Water Waves
- Vintage Filter
- Waves Style

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Requests
- PIL (Pillow)
- Matplotlib
- IO


## Results
Here are some examples of the applied filters:
- Gaussian Blur
- Edge Detection
- Cartoon Effect
- Histogram Equalization
- ORB Features

## Conclusion
This project helped me gain deeper insights into **Image Processing** techniques, computer vision, and how various filters impact visual data. I am excited to apply these skills in future **AI and Machine Learning** projects.
